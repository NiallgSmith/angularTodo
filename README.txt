Basic to do list in Angular

Situation assesment;
The 'using the packages' part of this is probably going to be more difficult than writing the toDo list, which I pretty much have done already. Other students are reporting problems with GitHub, 'Hydrating' their build, and other issues.
The issue with 'hydrate' I have seen personally.

Plan of action, get known good list app, (direct from Angular site) push to git repo, connect repo to phonegap, push, build, test, and with all of that set up, build a more complex toDo or personalise presentation or both time permitting, to prove I can write code, but do it with everything else in place to ship it out.


Update, as expected, a working list app on my local machine took an hour, even personalised and edited.
2 hours later it's in a git hub with a qr code, that I cannot open.

Update day 2, Still got a piece of functioning code on my laptop, and nothing more.
Have looked over my Angular app from Code institute, which had two controllers, and might implement a second here for something, but only if I can get the damn thing to open on my phone first.....

Update cont.

Ok, so now I have a QR code that does not work, but an apk that I mailed to myself, saved on my phone and installed, to reveal a broken app.

So, reverting back to the angular site Todo to eliminate that part of the possible problem brought me nothing. Still have a broken app.

Issues as they unfolded;

My QR reader doesn't work!!!! And there I was banging my head off a brick wall about THAT for 
I don't know how long......

Started from scratch, copied a config.xml and didn't update it properly. DOH.
I had a CDN loaded copy of Angular... Well, that was BOUND to cause a few issues...

And fatigue induced silliness. I was actually looking at saving data but at this stage....

It looks awful and has no style, but....
I'll have top look at this again tomorrow. Fatigue at this stage has limited the prospect of productive labour.
